## New Features

I added a few new features to David's excellent code, demonstratimg the power of those AVR Arduinos.

As other devices with more memory, the Nano can still do this and, morover, is fully 5V compliant! 


1.  Support for AppleII floppies

    Reading GCR formatted floppies is now supported, formattimg and writing is to be done.
    Images read use phisical sector order. Interleaving is required for use of images  in Mame etc.

    Select disk type 6 in  monitor ('t 6').

2.  Support for DD/SS floppies, e.g. DEC RX50

    Select with 't 5' 

3.  Monitor command to temporarily modify disk geometry

    'g t,s[,ts]'  max tracks, sectors, track spacing (1/2)

4.  Monitor command to read low level nibble/flux  data

    'n t,d,m'  track, delay from index hole/ms, mode

    mode: 
    1  Read nibble data with no wait
    2  Read flux data (cycles between pulses)
    3  Read nibbles after delay and waiting for GCR sector header
    4  Read nibbles after delay and waiting for GCR data header

5.  Caching for disk reads, nibble data

    Buffer size increase to 6656 bytes (1 nibble track) on Atmega MEGA


Code is "work in progess" and was tested on MEGA. Should work on Nano as well.

New features may be disabled by uncommenting defines for NIBBLES and GCR. 

Open issues: 
GCR Reading hangs on none GCR disks, or if head is stuck on track >35.
"motor on" from monitor does not work.
XModem works fine with TeraTerm, but fails with minicom.

Please feel free to contact me for questions/suggestions.
